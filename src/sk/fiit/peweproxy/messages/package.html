Contains classes for representations of HTTP messages.
A HTTP message is an entity that provides access to the actual message data. For direct
HTTP header access it provides references to corresponding HTTP header representations
(see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.headers}). Message body data, if a message carries one, can
be accessed only via using services accessible through provided service handle
(see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}).
<p>
There are two types of representations of HTTP messages, representations of request HTTP
message and HTTP response message. For each type, there are two representations providing
different level of access to HTTP message data, read only access and full access.
<p>
Every representation of a HTTP message provides access to two distinct HTTP header
representations: one for original HTTP header received by proxy (from the client or
web source) and one that will be sent by proxy server (to web source or the client).
Access to the original HTTP header is always read-only.
<p>
For read-only representations of the HTTP messages,
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.messages.HttpRequest} for request message and
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.messages.HttpResponse} for response message, provided
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle} will serve
only services (implementations of services) that do not modify message body data.
