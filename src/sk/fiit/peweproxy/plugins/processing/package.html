<title>Adaptive Proxy</title>
<body>
Contains interfaces for pluggable processing plugins.
A processing plugins is an external (3rd party) component that decides what to do with a
HTTP message. It's purpose is to decide what information to gather from a message or what
information should the message carry. It can directly read and modify HTTP header of the
message being processed, but can access it's body (if any) only indirectly by requesting
services present for that message (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle})
and calling their methods.
<p>
Plugins made to be integrated into the handling process of HTTP requests provide classes
implementing {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing.RequestProcessingPlugin}
interface. Plugins made to be integrated into the handling process of HTTP responses
provide classes implementing
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing.ResponseProcessingPlugin} interface.
<p>
When a request / response HTTP message is handled by the Adaptive Proxy platform, a
representation of the HTTP message is passed sequentially (configurable order) to all
successfully loaded request / response processing plugins (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing.RequestProcessingPlugin#processRequest(ModifiableHttpRequest)} and
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing.ResponseProcessingPlugin#processResponse(ModifiableHttpResponse)}).
Each processing plugin can read from the message or modify the message and decide what's
the next step in the message handling process. Either it let the same message representation
to be used in subsequent processing or it provides substitutive message. At the same time
it decides whether the message should be passed for processing to the rest of the processing
plugins, or it is a final message and should be sent right away. Request processing plugins
can also provide responses (which quits request processing sequence) and decide whether they
should be processed by loaded response processing plugins or are final and should be sent
right away. For detailed information on how a processing plugin signals platform how to
continue in message process handling, see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing.RequestProcessingPlugin.RequestProcessingActions}
for request processing plugins and
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing.ResponseProcessingPlugin.ResponseProcessingActions}
for response processing plugins.
<p>
For detailed information on setting an order in which Adaptive Proxy will pass HTTP message
being handled to processing plugins, see <a href="../../../../../custom/plugins_ordering">
