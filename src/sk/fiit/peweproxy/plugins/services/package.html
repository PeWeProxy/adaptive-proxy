<title>Adaptive Proxy</title>
<body>
Contains interfaces for pluggable services modules.
A service module is an external (3rd party) component that provides a service, therefore
knows how to work with HTTP message. It's purpose is to provide implementation(s) of 
particular service(s) that know how to gather particular information from a message or
how to modify a message to carry the information other plugin (processing plugin or
another module) wants to. These implementations can directly read and modify HTTP header
of the message being processed, but can access it's body (if any) only indirectly by
requesting other services present for that message (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}) and calling their methods.
<p>
Modules made to provide services over HTTP requests expose classes implementing
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.RequestServiceModule}
interface. Modules made to provide services over HTTP responses expose classes
implementing {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ResponseServiceModule} interface.
<p>
When a request / response HTTP message is processed by the Adaptive Proxy platform, a
representation of the HTTP message is passed sequentially to all successfully loaded
request / response processing plugins. To read or modify processed message, these plugins
need to use services available over that message obtained from message's
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}.
<p>
<b>Service discovery</b><br>
The mechanism of discovering what services (provided by modules) are available over
particular message is as follows:
<p>
<i>Message body caching</i><br>
When a HTTP header for incoming request / response message is received (before any
message body data is read), Adaptive Proxy platform requests every request / response
processing plugin to return a list of services (their definitions, i.e. interfaces of
those services) it would like to be able to use later in the processing phase. If it
finds one of the 4 base content services (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.content})
in the list, message body data will be cached and basic content services will be
available in the processing phase (text services availability depends on "Content-Type"
HTTP header, see proxy conf file, <code>stringServicesPattern</code> variable in <code>
AdaptiveEngine</code> section). If these base services are not find in the list, platform
then checks whether these services aren't "desired indirectly". This is when a plugin, in
order to do what it is made for, wants to be able to use some other service (other than
one of the 4 base services), which could be provided by plugged-in module if it could use
one of the 4 base services, even "indirectly". If one of the 4 base content services is
"desired indirectly", message body data will be cached and basic content services will
be available in the processing phase (again, condition for text services).
<p>
<i>Service implementation providing</i><br>
Modules provide services implementation by returning so called <i>service provider</i>
when asked to by passing service definition interface. Service provider in turn provides
service implementation that is an instance that implements service definition interface
and that will be returned to other plugins when they ask for that service. Having service
provider as a wrapper for a service implementation, and not only the implementation
directly, is needed to isolate service usage from introducing changes made by the service
implementation into the actual message data.
<p>
Since it's ineffective to write changes caused by using service to the message data
every single time any method of a service is called, service implementations are expected
to operate on their own inner model of a message, that is written to the message data
later when needed. Adaptive Proxy platform itself keeps watching when it's time to do
that. When its the right time, it is the service provider who introduce changes made in
the inner model of its service implementation to the actual message data. For more
information on requesting service providers and signaling service providers to introduce
changes to the actual message data, see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ServiceProvider} and it's subclasses.
<p>
<i>Discovering available services</i><br>
Adaptive Proxy platform keeps list of zero or many references to created and provided
service implementations inner models of which are considered up to date. If this list is
not empty, it either holds one or more service implementations inner models of which
are exact transformations of actual message data, or it holds single service
implementation inner model of which was modified so it is not exact transformation of
current message data it was built from.
<p>
Every time a plugin tries to access the message in a way that would make returned
information inaccurate, the modified inner model of some service implementation, if there
is such in the list, is written back to the actual message data, and the list is cleared.
This is when plugin tries to read or write HTTP header or use some service implementation
other than only one with up to date inner mode (if there is one).
<p>
Only when an implementation of requested service or service being used is not in the
list (was not created and considered with up to date inner model), modules that are able
to provide that service are requested one by one to return service provider providing
implementation of that service. This is the situation when read only representation of a
HTTP message is passed to modules and they are not expected / allowed to modify it in any
way. First time any module return non <code>null</code> service provider, its service
implementation is added to the list of implementations with up to date inner model.
Providing a service implementation itself can be a process that ends with service
implementation inner model of which is not exact transformation of the actual message
data it was built from. In such cases, service provider is expected to signal this (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ServiceProvider#initChangedModel()}).
<p>
Platform also differentiates two types of methods of the services based on what type of
access to the inner model of the service implementation (thus message itself) do they
provide - read only methods and modifying methods. To distinguish whether a method is
read only or not, special annotation
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ProxyService.readonly} is used. If a method in a service
definition (service interface) or a service implementation (provided by service provider)
is annotated with this <code>readonly</code> flag, platform will not clear list of
up to date service implementations, since it consider method to only read inner model of
the service implementation without modifying it in any way.
