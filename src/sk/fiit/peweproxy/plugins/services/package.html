Contains interfaces for pluggable services modules.
A service module is an external (3rd party) component that provides a service, therefore
knows how to work with HTTP message. It's purpose is to provide implementation(s) of 
particular service(s) that know how to gather particular information from a message or
how to modify a message to carry the information other plugin (processing plugin or
another module) wants to. These implementations can directly read and modify HTTP header
of the message being processed, but can access it's body (if any) only indirectly by
requesting other services present for that message (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}) and calling their methods.
<p>
Modules made to provide services over HTTP requests expose classes implementing
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.RequestServiceModule}
interface. Modules made to provide services over HTTP responses expose classes
implementing {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ResponseServiceModule} interface.
<p>
When a request / response HTTP message is processed (real-time or late message processing)
by the Adaptive Proxy platform, a representation of the HTTP message is passed sequentially
to all successfully loaded request / response processing plugins. To read or modify processed
message, these plugins need to use services available over that message obtained from
message's {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}, thus use active modules
indirectly.
<p>
<b>Service implementation providing</b><br>
Modules provide services implementation by returning so called <i>service provider</i>
when asked to (by platform passing service definition interface). Service provider in turn
provides service implementation that is an instance that implements service definition
interface and that will be returned to other plugins when they ask for that service. Having
service provider as a wrapper for a service implementation, and not only the implementation
directly, is needed to isolate service usage from introducing changes made by the service
implementation into the actual message data.
<p>
Since it's ineffective to write changes, caused by using service, to the message data
every single time any method of a service is called, service implementations are expected
to operate on their own inner model of a message, that is written to the message data
later when needed. Adaptive Proxy platform itself keeps watching when it's time to do
that. When its the right time, it is the service provider who introduce changes made in
the inner model of its service implementation to the actual message data. For more
information on requesting service providers and signaling service providers to introduce
changes to the actual message data, see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ServiceProvider} and it's subclasses.
<p>
Reason for having this 3 layer design (module - service provider - service implementation)
instead of just a module, also performing service provider's job, and a service
implementation, is to enable a service module to provide services that differ in both
identification and implementation. Different identification means that a module is allowed
to provide realizations of different services. Different implementation means that
a module is able to provide different implementations for the same service identification.
For example, a module can provide realizations of the same service, e.g. fictional search
results service, that differ heavily in code, thus being implemented in several other
classes. When asked for a service, a module then decides what class to return as a service
provider, based on actual message data. For example based on whether a message is a results
page of Google, Bing, Yahoo, or other search portal supported by module. 
<p>
<b>Discovering available services</b><br>
Adaptive Proxy platform keeps list of zero or many references to created and provided
service implementations inner models of which are considered up to date. If this list is
not empty, it either holds one or more service implementations inner models of which
are exact transformations of actual message data, or it holds single service
implementation inner model of which was modified so it is not exact transformation of
current message data it was built from.
<p>
Every time a plugin tries to access the message in a way that would make returned
information inaccurate, the modified inner model of some service implementation, if there
is such in the list, is written back to the actual message data, and the list is cleared
first. This is when plugin tries to read or write HTTP header or use some service
implementation other than only one with up to date inner mode (if there is one).
<p>
Only when an implementation of requested service or service being used is not in the
list (was not created and considered with up to date inner model), modules that are able
to provide that service are requested one by one to return service provider providing
implementation of that service. This is the situation when read only representation of a
HTTP message is passed to modules and they are not expected / allowed to modify it in any
way. That's why base services modifying a message (
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.content.ModifiableBytesService} and
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.content.ModifiableStringService}) won't be available
during this querying, which means that no message modifying services will be available.
First time any module return non <code>null</code> service provider, its service
implementation is added to the list of implementations with up to date inner model.
Providing a service implementation itself can be a process that ends with service
implementation inner model of which is not exact transformation of the actual message data
it was built from. In such cases, service provider is expected to signal this (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services.ServiceProvider#initChangedModel()}).
<p>
Platform also differentiates two types of methods of the services based on what type of
access to the inner model of the service implementation (thus message itself) do they
provide - read only methods and modifying methods. To distinguish whether a method is
read only or not, special annotation
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ProxyService.readonly} is used. If a method in a service
definition (service interface) or a service implementation (provided by service provider)
is annotated with this <code>readonly</code> flag, platform will not clear list of
up to date service implementations, since it consider method to only read inner model of
the service implementation without modifying it in any way.
