<title>Adaptive Proxy</title>
<body>
Contains interfaces for pluggable Adaptive Proxy plugins.
A plugin is an external (3rd party) component that adds some new functionality to the
Adaptive Proxy platform. To be pluggable into the platform, a plugin bundle must expose
a class that implements at least one <b>processing plugin</b> interface
(see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.processing}), <b>service module</b> interface (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.events}
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.services}) or <b>event plugin</b> interface, by making it
public and instatiable using public no-arg constructor.  
<p>
<b>Processing plugins</b> are plugins that decide what to do with a HTTP message. To
achieve their goals, they can access the message body via using services that get the
information and / or modifies the message for them. They are provided with services by
HTTP message's services handle (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.services.ServicesHandle}). 
<p>
<b>Modules</b> or service modules are plugins that provide implementation of particular
services to other plugins. Their purpose is to know how to get or modify information
from / of the message and perform such tasks when some other plugin requests it. 
<p>
Adaptive Proxy distinguishes two types of processing plugins and modules, those plugged
into the process of handling of HTTP requests and those for HTTP responses handling.
<p>
<b>Event plugins</b> are plugins that are notified by the platform when particular event
(e.g. connection close, failure or timeout) happens.
<p>
For the Adaptive Proxy platform, a plugin is a combination of <b>plugin's configuration
file</b> (XML file) in plugins home directory and a plugin bundle (plugin's binaries).
Plugin configuration file contains path to the bundle and the name of exactly one class 
in the bundle that will be loaded and instantiated to become an active plugin entity.
Plugin configuration file also specifies one or more types, that loaded plugin class can
act as (i.e. request/response processing plugin, request/response module or events plugin),
which of course requires the exposed class to implement appropriate interface. Plugin
configuration file and plugin bundle are not tied together (other than configuration file
contains path to the bundle), so there can multiple plugins loaded from the same bundle
(binaries), each with its own plugin configuration file referencing same binaries (even
same class within binaries). For more information on creating valid plugin configuration
file, see
<a href="doc-files/PluginConfiguration.dtd">Plugin configuration schema</a>.
<p>
Besides plugin's own runtime configuration parameters defined in plugin's configuration
file, all plugins can access global configuration parameters called <b>variables</b>,
defined in single variables file "<i>variables.xml</i>" in the plugins home directory. For
more information on creating valid variables file, see
<a href="doc-files/VariablesConfiguration.dtd">Variables configuration schema</a>.
<p>
This package contains common interafce for all plugins (see
{@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.ProxyPlugin}) that define the way a plugin is loaded,
configured and started. For more details on plugin's life cycle, see methods of
this class, namely {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.ProxyPlugin#start(PluginProperties)}
method.
<p>
Besides this base plugin interface, this package also contains common interfaces for all
request (see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.RequestPlugin}) and response plugins
(see {@link sk.fiit.peweproxy.plugins.ResponsePlugin}), that define the way a request
/ response plugins are asked for services they want to be available over the HTTP message
in the processing phase. This querying is done by Adaptive Proxy platform after the HTTP
header of any message is received (before message body is received and message is
processed by plugins) to decide, whether the platform will prefetch message body, what
introduces expensive operations into the message handling process.
